In this project, I've developed a robust Ticket Booking System utilizing Python programming language, SQLite3 for database management, and custom Tkinter for the user interface. The system provides users with a seamless experience for booking tickets for various movies.Through a well-designed graphical interface, users can easily navigate, select their desired tickets, and make reservations efficiently. Leveraging SQLite3, the system ensures data integrity and reliability, storing crucial information such as user details, booking history, and available tickets. The custom Tkinter interface not only enhances the user experience but also allows for flexibility in design and functionality, catering to specific project requirements. Overall, this project demonstrates the power and versatility of Python along with its libraries in developing practical solutions for real-world scenarios.
